# iwant-demo
A multi-module project that demonstrates features of the [iwant](http://iwant.sourceforge.net) build system

## Quick start: Studying the code with Eclipse

After cloning this repository, cd to it and type your first wish to shell (remember that tab is your friend - oh, and you are expected to have bash and other standard unix tools in your path, as well as a Java SDK):

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/help.sh

_Note how you don't need to install or configure anything. A small amount of bootstrapping code will ensure you have the correct version of iwant serving your build wishes._

As this is the first wish, it forces the iwant bootstrapper to bootstrap iwant and generate more wishes. Use tab again and issue the next wish:

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/side-effect/eclipse-settings/effective

Now that you have the Eclipse settings generated, you can import the projects to Eclipse. (Don't copy them to the workspace, just import.)

Modules `iwant-demo-wsdef` and `iwant-demo-wsdefdef` define the build, and the rest of the modules are production modules. Your first entrypoint to the build is [`IwantDemoWorkspaceModuleProvider.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdefdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdefdef/IwantDemoWorkspaceModuleProvider.java). (Use shift-ctrl-T to open it with Eclipse.) It defines the actual build module. The entrypoint to the build, defined as string here, is [`IwantDemoWorkspaceFactory.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdef/IwantDemoWorkspaceFactory.java). From that you can navigate your way with ctrl-click.

_Note how you can study how the build is defined by utilizing the Java type system and Eclipse navigation features instead of reading documentation and following loosely typed references and conventions._

## Studying test coverage (aka "running the tests")

When you have finished your initial study of the code you can make your next wish to get a test coverage report and pipe it to a browser:

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/target/jacoco-report-all/as-path | xargs -r -Ixxx chrome xxx/index.html

_Note how you didn't tell iwant to run tests. In fact, if you run the command again, it __wont' run them__ because you didn't change the code coverage by touching anything._

_Also note how all progress output of refreshing a target is printed to stderr, not stdout, so the output of the wish, the __path__ of the target, is the only thing that goes to the next process in the pipeline - xargs and chrome in this case._

## Building and running the application

To see the contents of the application cli distribution and to run it issue the following commands:

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/target/cli-distro/as-path | xargs -r find
    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/target/cli-distro/as-path && as-iwant-demo-developer/.i-cached/target/cli-distro/run.sh

_Note how easily [`CliDistro.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdef/CliDistro.java) includes all runtime dependencies of the application in the lib directory of the distribution._

Follow the error message of the application. For example, to print the first 4 prime numbers, type:

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/target/cli-distro/as-path && as-iwant-demo-developer/.i-cached/target/cli-distro/run.sh --primes 4

## Using code to build during build: code generation

The cli demonstrates usage of a generated javabean, `GeneratedBean`,  with the following command:

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/target/cli-distro/as-path && as-iwant-demo-developer/.i-cached/target/cli-distro/run.sh --generatedbean "new value"

See how [`IwantDemoModules.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdef/IwantDemoModules.java) defines `generatedJavaBeansJava.jar` as a jar of classes compiled from java files generated by a custom target, [`GeneratedJavaBean.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdef/GeneratedJavaBean.java).

The code generator [`JavaBeanGenerator.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/iwant-demo-javabean-generator/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/javabeangenerator/JavaBeanGenerator.java) is defined in a module that is not only built by the build system but also used by it during build. That's why it is defined very early, by [`IwantDemoWorkspaceModuleProvider.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdefdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdefdef/IwantDemoWorkspaceModuleProvider.java) and included as a dependency to the `iwant-demo-wsdef` module that defines most of the build.

## Cache validity of a custom target

Note how [`GeneratedJavaBean.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdef/GeneratedJavaBean.java) declares the ingredients it needs for generating the the java files. It not only declares the source file ([generated-javabeans/beans.txt](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/generated-javabeans/beans.txt)) it consumes as ingredients, but also its own java file and the classpath location that contains the code generator, `JavaBeanGenerator.class`.

This makes sure the target will be refreshed if you touch any of the declared ingredients.

Try this by how touching [`generated-javabeans/beans.txt`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/generated-javabeans/beans.txt), [`GeneratedJavaBean.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/as-iwant-demo-developer/i-have/wsdef/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/wsdef/GeneratedJavaBean.java) or [`JavaBeanGenerator.java`](https://github.com/wipu/iwant-demo/blob/master/iwant-demo-javabean-generator/src/main/java/org/oikarinen/iwantdemo/javabeangenerator/JavaBeanGenerator.java) causes a refresh of the target `generatedJavaBeansJava.classes` when requesting for example for target `cli-distro`.

_Also note how the target is *not* refreshed if none of its ingredients has changed._

## Static code analysis with findbugs

You can get a findbugs report by running:

    as-iwant-demo-developer/with/bash/iwant/target/findbugs-report/as-path | xargs -r -Ixxx chrome xxx/findbugs-report/findbugs-report.html
